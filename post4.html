                <h3>How to handle errors or bugs in a code??</h3>
                <p>Errors or bugs are inevitable in coding. They are the mistakes or defects that prevent the code from working as intended. Errors or bugs can be frustrating and time-consuming to deal with, but they can also be valuable learning opportunities. How can we handle errors or bugs in a code effectively and efficiently? 
                <br>
                Here are some tips that might help you:
                <ul>
                <li>Understand the error:</li>The first step to handle an error or bug is to understand what it is, why it occurred, and where it occurred. You can use tools such as debuggers, consoles, logs, and error messages to help you identify and analyze the error or bug. You can also use online resources such as Stack Overflow, MDN Web Docs, or W3Schools to search for the error or bug and find possible solutions or explanations.
                <li>Reproduce the error:</li>The second step to handle an error or bug is to reproduce it consistently and reliably. You can use tools such as test cases, breakpoints, and watch expressions to help you isolate and replicate the error or bug. You can also use tools such as Git or GitHub to track and manage the changes in your code and revert to previous versions if needed.
                <li>Fix the error:</li>The third step to handle an error or bug is to fix it by modifying your code. You can use tools such as editors, IDEs, linters, and formatters to help you edit and improve your code. You can also use tools such as comments, documentation, and naming conventions to help you make your code more readable and maintainable.
                <br>
                <li>Verify the fix:</li>The fourth step to handle an error or bug is to verify that the fix works as expected and does not introduce new errors or bugs. You can use tools such as unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to help you check and validate your code. You can also use tools such as code reviews, feedback, and peer programming to help you review and refine your code.
                <br>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Handling errors or bugs in a code is not easy, but it is not impossible either. It takes patience, perseverance, and problem-solving skills. It also takes curiosity, creativity, and collaboration. Handling errors or bugs in a code can be challenging, rewarding, and fun.
                <br>
